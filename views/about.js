						<p> Hello, </p>
						<p>I'm <b> Daniel Longo</b>, a sophomore at Woodside High School concurrently enrolled at Ca√±ada Community college.
					Outside of school, I enjoy running cross country and track.

					<p>
					I also like to code. In particular, I enjoy analyizing datasets and creating machine learning models.
						Over the past four years, I've worked with datasets from a variety of domains. These include trading data (scraped from exchange websites), medical datasets, image databases, kaggle datasets, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
					Some languages I am most familiar with are <b> Python, R, C++, Javascript, Swift, Java, and HTML & CSS</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Some tools I use most frequently are <b> React, Tensorflow, PyTorch, R-Studio, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Git (<a href="https://github.com/DanielLongo"> Github://DanielLongo</a>)</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Below are some of the projects and data visualizations I have been working on.
